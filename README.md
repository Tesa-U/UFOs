# UFOs
## Overview of Project:## 

Dana is a data scientist and has given the opportunity to write about a town in Oregon that is famous by its UFOs sightings. She has a task to analyze the raw data about UFO related information such as countries, cities, states, type of sighting and display it on the web as dynamic table. To provide more in–depth analysis and allow users to find precise information they need she added several filters to the page.

##Results: ##
The web site can be filtered in five ways such as occurred date, country, state, city, and shape where people can narrow down the information as the need.

##Summary:##

This website easily allows users to filter on the five different categories. There is one concern which is incorrect inputs (for example typo, a lot of the time people are not aware of their own error) might return ‘0’ search results. Two future recommendations for this project would be:
1.	Connecting map into the website where users can visualize the locations of UFO sightings.
2.	Solidifying the filtering capabilities by allowing for less strict user-text inputs
